# Alien3-C64
Alien3 Commodore C64 Source Code
(c)Michael J Archer


This is the entire source code for the 8-bit  C64 computer, written in 6502 Assembly Language.
The development was done on a PC via a PDS Development system, so it is not easily convertable to another target format.
There are several utilities used in the development, missing is the sprite editors and level designer tools. As these were on the actual C64 itself.

As this 30years old, looking at it myself I don't remember much as the code. But for sake of preservation with the current retro scene on the C64 I hope maybe someone finds something useful.
